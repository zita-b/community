    title: "Guardianship Of Children Without Families",
    description:
    "Legal guardianship is more durable but more complex than the transfer of custody to caregivers. Guardianship is most frequently used when relative caregivers wish to provide a permanent home for the child and maintain the child's relationships with extended family members without a termination of parental rights, as is required for an adoption. Guardianship is a strategy and permanency option that can help caregivers, including relatives, financially provide for a child without going through an adoption process.",

    title: "Helping The Elderly",
    description:
    "Many of us can expect to live well into our 80s as life expectancy rises, but this can also bring new difficulties, especially for those who donâ€™t have loved ones to help when daily duties grow harder. What happens, for example, to a senior who does not have children to care for them? Or if their spouse, who shared the day-to-day duties, passes away unexpectedly? That is why it is critical for community members to remember senior citizens who may require some assistance, kindness, compassion, and emotional support.",
